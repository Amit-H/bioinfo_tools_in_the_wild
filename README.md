### [MICOM](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/msystems.00606-19) - [Code](https://github.com/micom-dev/micom)
MICOM is a customisable metabolic model of the human gut microbiome that simulates microbial growth rates and metabolic interactions, providing insights into how diet and microbiome composition affect community function, with applications in health and disease contexts.
